# Smart Service Documentation

## Overview
Smart Service is a microservice-based system designed to manage and monitor smart devices and services. It provides a flexible and scalable architecture for handling various IoT devices and third-party service integrations.

## Key Features
- Smart Model and Feature Management
- Device and Service Integration
- Real-time Monitoring
- Scalable Architecture
- Enterprise-grade Security

## Architecture Overview

### System Components
1. **API Layer**
   - gRPC based API gateway
   - Request validation
   - Authentication & Authorization
   - Rate limiting

2. **Service Layer**
   - Model Service
   - Feature Service
   - Integration Service
   - Event handling

3. **Domain Layer**
   - Business rules
   - Domain models
   - Validation rules
   - Event definitions

4. **Integration Layer**
   - IoT device integration
   - Weather service integration
   - Custom integration support
   - Circuit breaker pattern
   - Retry mechanism

5. **Infrastructure**
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Redis cache
   - Kubernetes deployment
   - Prometheus metrics
   - ELK logging

### Design Patterns Used
1. **Domain-Driven Design**
   - Clear domain model
   - Rich domain objects
   - Domain events
   - Value objects

2. **Resilience Patterns**
   - Circuit Breaker
   - Rate Limiter
   - Retry with exponential backoff

3. **Clean Architecture**
   - Dependency inversion
   - Clear layer separation
   - Testable design
